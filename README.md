# RiceRocks
# Spaceship Game

This project is the capstone for the "Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python" course by the University of Michigan. It's built using Python and the SimpleGUICS2Pygame library to create a basic spaceship game that can be run locally.

## Installation

Before running the game, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You'll also need to install the SimpleGUICS2Pygame library, which can be done via pip:

pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame

## Running the Game

With Python and SimpleGUICS2Pygame installed, you can run the game by navigating to the game's directory in your command line or terminal and executing the script:

python ricerocks.py

## Gameplay

Use the keyboard to control the spaceship:

- Arrow keys to rotate and accelerate.
- Space to shoot

## Credits

Game design and assets are used in accordance with the course's guidelines. Sound assets were purchased from sounddogs.com. The SimpleGUICS2Pygame library was used to adapt the game for local execution.
